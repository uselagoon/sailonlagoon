# Sailing Lagoon Stubs

Essentially inspired by (stolen from?) Sail's implementation,
this directory contains a number of stubs used to generate the Lagoon specific docker-compose file.

Each "stub" is a yaml file that should define a service, which is merged into the "services" stanza of the docker-compose.stub file.
This file with all merged services will end up in ./lagoon/docker-compose.yml

It is generated by looking at the existing docker-compose.yml file in a Sail Laravel installation, and generating the corresponding version of the stubs there.
